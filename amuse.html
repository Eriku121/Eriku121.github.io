<h2> Wordle : New York Times </h2> 
<p> Wordle is a fun website where everday there is a new word for you to guess. The game consists of 6 attempts but after every attempt if you guess the correct letter in that word </p> 
<p> you know by the color that it lights up as. Yellow means the letter is correct but in the wrong spot, green means its the correct letter and in the correct spot. </p> 
<p> The word is also only 5 letters long so its a fun and time killing game you can play as you wait. </p>

<h2> Vendetta Archive </h2> 
<p> Vendetta is a clothing website where I think has one of the best handmade clothing. It is from the United Kindom so it is charged in Euros, but regardless the clothes is fairly cheap for the amount of work that goes into each piece. </p>
