<p1> Wordle is a fun website where everday there is a new word for you guess. The game consists of 6 attempts but after every attempt if you guess the correct letter in that word </p1> 
<p1> you know by the color that it lights up as. Yellow means the letter is correct but in the wrong spot, green means its the correct letter and in the correct spot. </p1> 
<p1> The word is also only 5 letters long so its a fun and time killing game you can play as you wait. </p1>
