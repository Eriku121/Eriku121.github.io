<h1><em> Hector Bellerin</em> </h1> 
<h2> My inspiration </h2> 
<p>----------------------</p> 

<p> Growing up, I played a lot of soccer within my years in Highschool. I always idolized Hector, for his talents, his attitude, and his style in clothing. </p>
<p> To me he was the complete player. He was fast, a defense player like me, and he played for my favorite club at that time which was Arsenal FC. </p> 
<p> For me that was a main reason for academic and athletic success as I wanted to be in his shoes. Although that didn't workout as I wanted to, </p> 
<p> I can still say he was a huge inspiration for me growing up. </p>
